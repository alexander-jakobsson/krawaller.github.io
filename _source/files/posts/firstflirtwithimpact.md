excerpt: A quick experiment with ImpactJS and Box2D

A few weekends ago, I got to shut myself in with my two brothers and a few friends in the Spotify Gothenburg office. Counterstrike, Nerf gun wars, FIFA tournaments and male bonding ensued! Most importantly, we had a night-long hack trying out Impact for the first time. So much fun!! It felt like I got a taste of LDG life, hacking away with my brothers, dividing tasks and thinking up new ideas.

As weekends have an unfortunate habit of ending we didn't get too far (also the constant temptation of another CS round didn't help), but leaving the office we did have a working prototype of a classic (same-computer) multiplayer tank game. We built with Impact and Box2D, a very nice although woefully undocumented marriage.
