Like everyone else I've been playing around with the newly released <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>. Buckets of fun! But I was quickly made aware that I still haven't really understood <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flexbox</a>, which React Native uses for layout.

In order to alleviate that I built an interactive demo app where you can change the related props for the container and the children, and see first hand what the resulting layout looks like. This helped me a lot, so I share it here hoping it can help you too! It is published <a href="">here</a>.

Putting the demo app together was a lot of fun! I used React (of course), and it turned out to be a great fit for this particular project. I hope to write a followup post and walk through the <a href="">source code</a>.
